# Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using Suricata

This repository contains the implementation and setup of a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using Suricata, an open-source IDS/IPS engine. The system is designed to capture and analyze network traffic, detect malicious activity, and generate alerts based on pre-defined security rules.

## How I Worked on the Project

1. *Initial Setup*
   - Installed Suricata on my system to enable network traffic capture and analysis.
   - Configured the Suricata configuration file (/etc/suricata/suricata.yaml) to specify network interfaces and other necessary settings.

2. *Capturing Network Traffic*
   - Started Suricata using the command:
     bash
     sudo suricata -i eth0
     
     This captures traffic on the specified network interface (eth0 in this case).

3. *Configuring Suricata to Monitor Traffic*
   - Suricata was configured to monitor packets, identify various protocols (like TCP, UDP, ICMP), and log the traffic.
   - It uses the afpacket capture method to intercept packets at the kernel level.
   - Set up logging to output to specific directories, such as:
     yaml
     logging:
       default-log-level: info
       outputs:
         - file:
             filename: /var/log/suricata/suricata.log
             append: yes
     

4. *Traffic Analysis*
   - Once Suricata starts running, it analyzes incoming and outgoing traffic, categorizing it into types like HTTP, TLS, DNS, etc.
   - The output includes:
     - Packet statistics
     - Session details (TCP, UDP, etc.)
     - Application layer protocols (HTTP, DNS, etc.)

5. *Handling Alerts and Events*
   - Suricata is set up to generate alerts when suspicious activities are detected based on rules.
   - Alerts were captured in a specified log file, and I monitored them periodically to track suspicious activities.

6. *Stopping Suricata*
   - The process can be stopped at any time by pressing Ctrl + C in the terminal, which halts the traffic capture and analysis.

7. *GitHub Integration*
   - Once the system was set up and the traffic analysis was successfully running, I pushed the project to GitHub.
   - Included the following in my repository:
     - Suricata configuration files
     - Sample network traffic capture logs
     - Instructions for setting up Suricata and running the system

## How to Set Up the System

1. *Install Suricata*
   Follow the instructions on [Suricata's installation guide](https://suricata.io/download/) for your platform (Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.).

2. *Configure Suricata*
   Edit the suricata.yaml file to set the desired network interfaces and logging options.

3. *Start Suricata*
   Run the following command to start capturing traffic on the specified interface:
   bash
   sudo suricata -i <interface-name>
   

4. *Monitor the Output*
   Suricata will output logs to the /var/log/suricata/ directory. You can monitor these logs for detected events.

5. *Stop Suricata*
   To stop Suricata, press Ctrl + C.

## Files Included
- suricata.yaml: Suricata configuration file.
- logs/: Folder containing captured network traffic logs.
- README.md: Documentation for setting up and using the system.

## Conclusion

This project helped me gain hands-on experience in network traffic analysis and intrusion detection using Suricata. I learned how to configure the tool to detect network-based threats and analyze packets in real-time.

This should provide a detailed explanation of how you worked on your NIDS project using Suricata and how others can set it up and use it based on your work.
